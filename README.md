## Java Version 16 (soon to be Version 17)

If running Java 11, make the following temporary changes to get the app to compile:

- Modify pom.xml java.version from 16 to 11.
- Modify ZooApp.java: comment out the new switch statement 

## 4 Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Encapsulation. Wrap code in good interfaces. Hide private data, expose publicly accessible methods.
- Abstraction. Abstract general ideas that work for many, e.g. move is an abstraction of crawl, slither, fly.
- Inheritance. Write once in a parent class and all the derived child classes get it for free.
- Polymorphism. "Many shapes". One thing (e.g. move) can take many forms, e.g. a snake might move by slithering, while a bird might move by flying.
